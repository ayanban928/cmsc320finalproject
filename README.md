# CMSC320 Final Project

# Introduction
For our final project in CMSC320, we will be working with the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. The dataset includes key features such as Date, Customers, Sales, Store information, Promotions, etc.

# Project Goal
Our objective is to develop a machine learning model to predict future store sales based on historical data. 
We aim to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast future sales, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
